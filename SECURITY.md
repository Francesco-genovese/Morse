## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by [creating an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/issues) in the GitHub repository.

We take security seriously and will do our best to address reported vulnerabilities promptly. Once a vulnerability is reported, you can expect regular updates on its status. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will provide information on the planned fix and release timeline. If declined, we will explain the reasons for the decision.
